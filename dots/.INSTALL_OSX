boot off install disk, repartition drive into two partitins one HFS and the second UFS
-make doc small, turn off mag, max out keyrepeat speed
-install OSX fresh on HFS partition
	-DON't let stupid thing put a blank in ufs partition name as this will cause absolute 
	path of files in ufs partition to contain a blank. This will screw up old fashioned tools.
	-use diskutil rename to fix if too late.
	-ufs0, osxhfs
-install XCode 1.5 (from connect.apple.com. NOT from 1.0 which lacks crt0.o))
	-fink home page reckons gcc herein is busted, so apply
	-november2004GCCUpdater from connect
-scp newunix.sh from an up-to-date ~/dots directory. 
-execute newunix.sh
	-ln -s dots/Emacs .
	-fix up .ssh links (using scp creates .ssh which scares off newunix.sh)
	-cvsz co my-gmacs
	-cvsz co bin
-install X11 from apple website
-rsync -avuzb m0:Library  -
	-note: this seems to make Mail, Safari, calendar and addressbook just work.
-install Fink from sourceforge
-copy FINKcommander into /apps
-install xemacs tetex psutils ispell gv ghostscript
-fiddle tetex to search for local files. (See install advice on home page of ctan.org.)
-fink install netpbm10
	-reliable only after xcode 1.5 installed and patched.
gzip -dc /sw/src/netpbm-10.12.tgz | /sw/bin/tar -xf -  --no-same-owner --no-same-permissions 
sed 's|@PREFIX@|/sw|g' </sw/fink/dists/stable/main/finkinfo/graphics/netpbm10.patch | patch -p1

GNUmakefile:60: /Volumes/Macintosh: No such file or directory
-install msoffice from cdrom
-install photoshop from cdrom
-install illustrator from cdrom
	-update both from adobe site.
-
-fake out iTunes by linking ~/Music/iTunes/'iTunes Music' to /Volumes/whatever/mymusic
	-trick seemed to be to blow away the uplevel file that iTunes 4 created when it was upgraded.
-download gnupg from gnupg.org. configure, make, sudo make install
-rsync -avuzb 192.168.0.4:.gnupg .
-rsync -avuzb a bunch of dirs
	-doc,p,mymusic,img,gpg
-fake out iPhoto by making ~/Pictures a symlink to unix img directory.

-cvs co darwinports

-install PalmDesk top. 
	-can't unstuff installer in a ufs dir. copy to /tmp unpacks there okay.
	-seems that the cradle must be unplugged
	-get isync palmos conduit and install it (apple/isync)
	-instructions in iSync help pages

-keygen for sshd
	-run ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" --> /etc/ssh_host_rsa_key
    -dsa
     -rsa1 (I guessed that this goes to ssh_host_key because it wanted to write
            to identity by default, the old place)
    -this is probably wrong. anyways, can't ssh in

-set up istop modem access. (check access numbers)
-get binutils from gnu.org, configure, install
	-this was a pain. I couldn't see how to configure all the pieces at once so I had to
     configure and make the bfd & opcodes dirs before the binutil dir would make
    -carefull! installs duplicates of apple programs (ar) in /usr/bin. 

-fonts. Get fondu (Fink) and run it to convert OSX .dfont fonts into TT fonts.
 - fondu  /System/Library/Fonts/*.dfont # creates a bunch of .ttf files
 -mkfontdir # to create a fonts.dir file
 -xset +fp /Users/matz/Library/Fonts # to tell X to look for the new fonts


-install gaim-ssl using fink. Need to go from source. recompile takes an hour!
 a bit flaky. aborts a few times in only a few hours.

-install ucontrol. Finally can use PC keyboard properly.

-install adium. Wow, that's pretty. It even seems to work.
 (Needs SOCKS4 proxy and ssh -D nnnn to run behind firewalls)

-tweak latex to no longer assume A4 paper.
 make letter default in /sw/share/texmf/dvips
 as per advice in http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/sigfaq.htm#a1

-make old pgp IDEA key work in gpg
	get idea.c from http://www.gnupg.org/why-not-idea.html
	then compile using: gcc -Wall -O2 -bundle -o idea idea.c
    then edit gpg.conf to add:
    load-extension ~/gpg/idea


-add "location" for standalone net to connect to tp0. Totally
disposable if causes trouble

-add latex datetime package in /sw/share/texmf-local

-install audioX as could not find Apple utility to do what it does

-install RsyncX because it includes HFS filesystem support.
 nevertheless, it appears to be a bit busted when used -a on symbolic links one one osx machine.

-hackery concerning epocrates install for Harriet.
-freebie installer EpocratesMac wouldn't work complaining about perms.
 chown -R matz /Libarary/ApplicationSupport/Palm HotSync
 chmod -R g+w
 then it runs and fetches Epocrates as it should. and hotsyncs harriet's pilot

-lgrind (for ben) download from CTAN/http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/entries/lgrind.html
 build (comment out #include malloc.h)
 ln -s /sw/share/texmf-local /usr/share/texmf
 ln -s /sw/share/man /usr	
 make install
 **is this sensible? when I rebuild /sw I will wreck this stuff.
 **instead, Should I have put /sw/share/texmf-local somewhere in my directories?
 
-Firefox 1.0.3 and hack for emacs key bindings
 edit /Applications/Firefox.app/res/builtin/platformHTMLBindings.xml as suggested in 
 http://kb.mozillazine.org/Emacs_Keybindings_(Firefox)
 
-export bookmarks from safari using "safari bookmark exporter" tool that blasted them 
straight into firefox.

-fiddled with Palm stuff attempting to install adobe pdf reading prc. busted sync

-lacie firewire drive
 use Disk Utility to create a 27.76 G mac os extended (journaled) partition
 Note that the partition function does NOT format a filesystem
 Select the partition (volume) and erase to create a partition.
 This failed for me a few times with  "could not unmount volume". then worked??

 +MUST clear "ignore ownership on this volume" or files will end up owned by matz

 +can use silverlining to make a bootable copy.

 +install newer rsync 2.6.3 which seems to have chmod problem fixed
 +MUST bless the destination at least after first rsync, perhaps after each.
   this seems to copy boot loaders and such. without this open firmware will not
   display the destination partition as a bootable filesystem.

  bless -verbose -folder /Volumes/m1_osxhfs_back/System/Library/CoreServices  -bootinfo /usr/standalone/ppc/bootx.bootinfo

 +write ~matz/bin/backup_m1_osxhfs.sh to use rsyncx to backup the root fs.

-when powering on now hold alt/option key (NOT command). 
-open firmware displays an icon for each partition containing a bootable filesys
-if no icon for m1_ofshfs_back then click refresh curved arrow button.
-click m1_ofshfs_back icon (it indents) and click button with right arrow.

This is what mount says normally, when booted off the internal:

m1.local $ mount
/dev/disk0s3 on / (local, journaled) ********* disk0 ************
devfs on /dev (local)
fdesc on /dev (union)
<volfs> on /.vol
/dev/disk0s5 on /Volumes/ufs0 (asynchronous, local)
automount -nsl [307] on /Network (automounted)
automount -fstab [321] on /automount/Servers (automounted)
automount -static [321] on /automount/static (automounted)
/dev/disk1s2 on /Volumes/m1_osxhfs_back (local, nodev, nosuid, journaled) ******
/dev/disk1s3 on /Volumes/LACIE_2 (local, nodev, nosuid)

This is what mount says when booted off the external:

devfs on /dev (local)
fdesc on /dev (union)
<volfs> on /.vol

Let's hope we never need this!

-build darwinports aspell in /opt/local/bin. Then realized that all that was msising was english dictionary. So installed that from fink. now both versions work.

-firefox hack for disabling forward/back on scrollwheel.
:about:config
mousewheel.horizscroll.withnokey.action to 0
mousewheel.horizscroll.withnokey.numlines to 1
this is probably overkill. seems to stop horizontal scrolling within a wide page too.

-a bunch of fink stuff attempting to build firefox. See http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mac_OS_X_Build_Prerequisites
 note firefox -profileManager to set default profile

-chud 4.2.2 upgrade
  -still busted after all these years

-install python 2.3.3 and documentation
 -python IDE

-install eclipse 3.1.1 skd
 -pydev plug in. 

-hack around learning how info works.
  -basic idea is that each dir in INFOPATH must contain a file dir
   that lists the modules (mumble) in the dir.
   for i in *.info ; do /usr/bin/install-info $i dir; done

-ssh-add under osx login
from http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031217081557968&query=passwordless+ssh
followed part of these instructions to make login hooks, etc.

[ IMPORTANT - this script assumes user home directories are still in the default location of /Users/. If you've moved them, either adjust this script, or figure out how to make it more complicated by looking up the user home directories dynamically via something like getpwnam() ... ]
# Make sure the file and directory have proper ownership and permissions:

# chmod -R 755 /Library/Hooks
# chown -R root:wheel /Library/Hooks

# Create a link to this file, called LogoutHook:

# ln /Library/Hooks/LoginHook /Library/Hooks/LogoutHook

# Enable the login hooks via the defaults command:

# defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook "/Library/Hooks/LoginHook"
# defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook "/Library/Hooks/LogoutHook"

-build x11-ssh-askpass-1.2.4.1
 it installs in wrong place. make link to /usr/libexec

-ssh technique was in Jonathan's .xinitrc all along. use ssh-agent -a to create a fifo in .ssh.
-Mac trick is to create a new file ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist

<?xml version="1.0" encodings="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
        <key>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</key>
        <string>/Users/matz/.ssh/ssh-agent.socket</string>
</dict>
</plist>

Now all shells can assume that  SSH_AUTH_SOCK will be set

-disable annoying f9,f10,f11 behaviour in system preferences/expose

-voodoo pad command key to menu item. use system pref->keyboard & mouse->keyboard shortcuts to add keybinding for menu item.
-this seems to be a gui in front of the defaults mechanism.

-I cannot figure out how to make Terminal use the command key as the meta.

-trip across how to make cvs-idiff diff against HEAD rather than BASE
pcl-cvs.el:
;;matz
(cvs-flags-define cvs-idiff-version
		  (list "HEAD" cvs-vendor-branch cvs-vendor-branch "HEAD" "HEAD")
		  "version: " cvs-qtypedesc-tag)

;(cvs-flags-define cvs-idiff-version
;		  (list "BASE" cvs-vendor-branch cvs-vendor-branch "BASE" "BASE")
;		  "version: " cvs-qtypedesc-tag)


Look into diskutil failure attempting to format an existing partition as hfs+
-newfs_hfs -v vollab /dev/rdisk1s4
-mount_hfs /dev/disks4 /tmp/mnt
-there are layers of tools here not cooperating.
-diskutil fails saying  "could not unmount volume". then worked??
-logging in as root, rebooting, other superstitious activity did not help.
-found command line utilities newfs_hfs and mount_hfs that seemed to work fine.
-but diskutil then did not realize this had been done and still shows the partition as a dos file system.
-and, next time I boot, the device has moved from /dev/disk1s4 to /dev/disk2s4. 
-interesting, attempting to erase the filesys again in diskutil doesn't hurt the file system. 

-add symlink ln -s /Users /home
 -to help scripts that assume the linux layout.

-install Retrospect upgrade. Browse backup still busted.
-install TclTkAqua. Now Tkinter works in pythonw.

-install MacTheRipper to copy Sanjit Ray disks
 For our simple backups are better off using Disk Utility

-install Microsoft Remote Access Client
	http://www.microsoft.com/mac/otherproducts/otherproducts.aspx?pid=remotedesktopclient

-Mail.app busted !!
-no, it was GPGMail. http://www.sente.ch/pub/software/GPGMail/GPGMail-10.4.dmg

-mystery process mds using up tonnes of cpu.
 -spotlight indexer in confused state. See http://www.macintouch.com/tiger12.html
looks like cvs, build using xemacs and jamv build work.

-install Xcode 2.0 from distro (now gdb 6.1, gcc 4.0.0)
-port jam to gcc 4.0.0 (see blog)

-download xcode 2.2.1 and 
    - gcc version 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5250)
    - GNU gdb 6.1-20040303 (Apple version gdb-437) (Sun Dec 25 08:31:29 GMT 2005)

-upgrade CHUD again
-blow away old copies of Voodoo 
-install Fetch

-lyx won't render because various tools are missing. Smells like new lyx with revision history needs updated tetex tools.
-install new fink 0.8.1
-move aside old fink (and all the goodies therein) to /Volumes/ufs0/sw.0.7.1
-binary install tetex. (It says 200M download will unpack to 1/2 G or so)

ohoh, not looking very promising..
etex:                 unreadable symlink `etex' (No such file or directory)
lambda:               unreadable symlink `lambda' (No such file or directory)
lamed:                unreadable symlink `lamed' (No such file or directory)
latex:                unreadable symlink `latex' (No such file or directory)
pdflatex:             unreadable symlink `pdflatex' (No such file or directory)
pdftex:               unreadable symlink `pdftex' (No such file or directory)

whereas the old fink install had:
m1.local $ file etex lambda lamed latex pdflatex pdftex
etex:     Mach-O executable ppc
lambda:   symbolic link to `omega'
lamed:    cannot open (lamed)
latex:    symbolic link to `tex'
pdflatex: symbolic link to `pdftex'
pdftex:   Mach-O executable ppc

first, i tried to link latex to tex. This failed with assertion informing me that some intermediate file had been created with pdfetex

-cd (the new) /sw/bin && sudo ln -s pdfetex latex
-this builds cgo2005 paper (dvips to postscript and dvipdf to pdf)
-fink install gv (ghostscript already there)

feel brave, so link ln -s pdfetex pdflatex  also
now lyx 1.4.1 renders stuff to ps and pdf

-fink install xemacs, sumo
-fink install netpbm10 (version 10 of net pbm) (seems to be lots fewer tools than previously)
-fink install bzip
-fink install ispell
-lyx ignores request to use xemacs key bindings
