!osx xterm appears to want meta_L modifier to do the command line editing.
!xemacs seems not to care whether it seems meta_l or alt_l.
!so we bind them together so that can preserve sanity when working on 
!a PC keyboards that swaps the alt and meta keys relative to apple keyboards.
!I bet there is a way of swapping them deeper down in aqua.


clear mod1
clear mod2

!try and trick apps into using both keys.
!send same keycode from alt and meta
!works for xemacs -- lyx always seems to use same keycode.

keycode 63 = Meta_L
keycode 66 = Meta_L

!emacs meta and lyx command keys look for modifier bits.
add mod1 = Meta_L
