@section Installing a release

Choose to install a release if you want to minimize risk.

Errors are corrected in development first.  Once fixes are confirmed, a
new release will be made.  User-visible changes will be announced on the
@email{emacs-wiki-discuss@@nongnu.org} mailing list.  @pxref{Getting
Help and Reporting Bugs}.

@cindex Debian package for emacs-wiki

Debian users can get emacs-wiki via apt-get.  The version of
emacs-wiki in the Debian stable archive is not recommended, since it
is so old.  @file{emacs-wiki} is available in the Sarge and Sid
distributions: @kbd{apt-get install emacs-wiki} .

@cindex releases, from source

You can also install the source distribution.

@enumerate
@item Download and unpack the latest version from @uref{http://www.mwolson.org/static/dist/emacs-wiki/} .
@item Edit your @file{~/.emacs}.

@example
;; Add the directories to your load path
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/emacs-wiki")
;; Load emacs-wiki

@chapter Wiki Concepts
@cindex @file{emacs-wiki.el}, using
@cindex wiki concepts
@cindex mixed case
@cindex camel case

Wiki is a concept, more than a thing.  It is a way of creating
document pages using plain text markup and simplified hyperlinking.

By typing a name in MixedCase (also known as CamelCase), a hyperlink
is automatically created to the document @file{MixedCase}.  Pressing
return on that name will create the file if it doesn't exist, or visit
it if it does.

The markup used by Emacs-Wiki is intended to be very friendly to
people familiar with Emacs.  Type @kbd{C-h v
emacs-wiki-publishing-markup} after this mode is loaded for more
information on how to get started.

Wiki's are often associated with sites that allow collaborative
editing of a website.  emacs-wiki is not meant to produce this sort of
site, although you can use Emacs to serve web pages.  See
@file{emacs-wiki-httpd.el} for more information.  Note that this
feature is not well-tested.

@node Getting Started, Keystroke Summary, Wiki Concepts, Top
@chapter Getting Started

To begin using Emacs-Wiki, put this in your @file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(load ``emacs-wiki'')
@end lisp

Now you can type @kbd{M-x emacs-wiki-find-file}, give it a WikiName
(or just hit return) and start typing!

You should also type @kbd{M-x customize-group}, and give the name
@samp{emacs-wiki}.  Change it to suit your preferences.  Each of the
options has its own documentation.

@node Basic WikiMarkups, Changing Title or Stylesheet, Markup Rules, Markup Rules
@section Basic WikiMarkups

Here is a description of the default markup rules:

@emph{Headings}

@verbatim
      * First level
      ** Second level
      *** Third level
@end verbatim

Note that the first level is actually indicated using H2, so that
it doesn't appear at the same level as the page heading (which
conceptually titles the section of that Wiki page).

@emph{Horizontal rules}

@verbatim
      ----
@end verbatim

@emph{Emphasis}

@verbatim
      *emphasis*
      **strong emphasis**
      ***very strong emphasis***
      _underlined text_
      =verbatim=
@end verbatim

@verbatim
      <verbatim>This tag should be used for larger blocks of text</verbatim>.
@end verbatim

@emph{Footnotes}

A reference[1], which is just a number in square brackets,
constitutes a footnote reference.

@verbatim
      Footnotes:

      [1]  Footnotes are defined by the same number in brackets
           occurring at the beginning of a line.  Use footnote-mode's C-c
           ! a command, to very easily insert footnotes while typing.  Use
           C-x C-x to return to the point of insertion.
@end verbatim

@emph{Paragraphs}

One or more blank lines separates paragraphs.

@emph{Centered paragraphs and quotations}

A line that begins with six or more columns of whitespace (made up
of tabs or spaces) indicates a centered paragraph.  I assume this
because it's expected you will use M-s to center the line, which
usually adds a lot of whitespace before it.

If a line begins with some whitespace, but less than six columns, it
indicates a quoted paragraph.

@emph{Poetic verse}

Poetry requires that whitespace be preserved, without resorting to
the monospace typical of <pre>.  For this, the following special
markup exists, which is reminiscent of e-mail quotations:

@verbatim
       > A line of Emacs verse;
       > forgive its being so terse.
@end verbatim

You can also use the <verse> tag, if you prefer:

@verbatim
       <verse>
       A line of Emacs verse;
       forgive its being so terse.
       </verse>
@end verbatim

@emph{Literal paragraphs}

Use the HTML tags <pre></pre> to insert a paragraph and preserve
whitespace.  If you're inserting a block of code, you will almost
always want to use <verbatim></verbatim> *within* the <pre> tags.
The shorcut for doing this is to use the <example> tag:

@verbatim
       <example>
       Some literal text or code here.
       </example>
@end verbatim

@emph{Tables}

There are two forms of table markup supported.  If Takaaki Ota's
table.el package is available, then simply create your tables using
his package, and they will be rendered into the appropriate HTML.
You need to (require 'emacs-wiki-table) for this functionality.

If table.el is not available, then only very simple table markup is
supported.  The attributes of the table are kept in
`emacs-wiki-table-attributes'.  The syntax is:

@verbatim
       Double bars || Separate header fields
       Single bars | Separate body fields
       Here are more | body fields
       Triple bars ||| Separate footer fields
@end verbatim

Other paragraph markup applies to both styles, meaning that if six
or more columns of whitespace precedes the first line of the table,
it will be centered, and if any whitespace at all precedes first
line, it will occur in a blockquote.

@emph{Anchors and tagged links}

#example If you begin a line with "#anchor" -- where anchor
can be any word that doesn't contain whitespace -- it defines an
anchor at that point into the document.  This anchor text is not
displayed.

You can reference an anchored point in another page (or even in the
current page) using WikiName#anchor.  The #anchor will never be
displayed in HTML, whether at the point of definition or reference,
but it will cause browsers to jump to that point in the document.

@emph{Redirecting to another page or URL}

Sometimes you may wish to redirect someone to another page.  To do
this, put:

@verbatim
       <redirect url=\"http://somewhereelse.com\"/>
@end verbatim

at the top of the page.  If the <redirect> tag specifies content,
this will be used as the redirection message, rather than the
default.

The numbers of seconds to delay is defined by
`emacs-wiki-redirect-delay', which defaults to 2 seconds.  The page
shown will also contain a link to click on, for browsing which do
not support automatic refreshing.

@emph{URLs}

A regular URL is given as a link.  If it's an image URL, it will
be inlined using an IMG tag.

@emph{Special handling of WikiNames}

If you need to add a plural at the end of a WikiName, separate it
with four single quotes (WikiName''''s) or make it an explicit
link ([[WikiName]]s).

To prevent a link name (of any type) from being treated as such,
surround it with =equals= (to display it in monotype), or prefix it
with the tag <nop> to escape it from WikiName markup.

@emph{Special Wiki links}

Besides the normal WikiName type links, emacs-wiki also supports
extended links:

@verbatim
       [[link text][optional link description]]
@end verbatim

An extended link is always a link, no matter how it looks.  This
means you can use any file in your `emacs-wiki-directories' as a
Wiki file.  If you provide an optional description, that's what will
be shown instead of the link text.  This is very useful for
providing textual description of URLs.

See the documentation to emacs-wiki-image-regexp for how to inline
files and images.

@emph{InterWiki names}

There are times when you will want to constantly reference pages on
another website.  Rather than repeating the URL ad nauseum, you can
define an InterWiki name.  This is a set of WikiNames to URL
correlations, that support textual substitution using #anchor names
(which are appended to the URL).  For example, MeatballWiki is
defined in the variable `emacs-wiki-interwiki-names'.  It means you
can reference the page \"MeatBall\" on MeatballWiki using this
syntax:

@verbatim
       MeatballWiki#MeatBall
@end verbatim

In the resulting HTML, the link is simply shown as

@verbatim
       MeatballWiki:MeatBall
@end verbatim

@node Changing Title or Stylesheet, Lists, Basic WikiMarkups, Markup Rules
@section Changing Title or Stylesheet

For convenience, if you want to change the visible title or the
stylesheet used by a certain Wiki page during HTML publishing,
just put:

@example
#title Hello there
#style hello.css
@end example

at the top of the page.

@node Lists, Images, Changing Title or Stylesheet, Markup Rules
@section Lists

Whitespace is required after bullets and numbers thot are part of a
list.

Here is an example:

@example
- This
- Is
- A
- List

1. This
2. too

But this is not,
--even if it starts with dashes
0.1] or numbers, as in the original test case.
@end example

@strong{Sub-lists?}

There is no inherent support for sub-lists, since the author couldn't
think of a simple way to do it.  But if you really need them, here's a
trick you can use:

@example
 - Hello
   <ul>
   <li>There
   <li>My friend
   </ul>
@end example

@node Images, Lisp Tricks, Lists, Markup Rules
@section Images

You can include links of the form @samp{[[some/link][some/image]]}. If
you want to include @var{alt} text, use @samp{[[some/link][some/image
alt text]]}.

You may need to have @code{auto-image-file-mode} set to @samp{t} for
this to work.

@node Lisp Tricks, Non-existent Links, Images, Markup Rules
@section Lisp Tricks

@code{<lisp></lisp>} tags can be used, not only to evaluate forms for
insertion at that point, but to influence the publishing process in
many ways.  Here's another way to change a page's stylesheet:

@smallexample
<lisp>
(ignore
  ;; use special.css for this Wiki page
  (set (make-variable-buffer-local 'emacs-wiki-style-sheet)
       "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"special.css\" />"))
</lisp>
@end smallexample

The @code{ignore} is needed so nothing is inserted where the
@code{<lisp>} tag occurred.  Also, there should be no blank lines
before or after the tag (to avoid empty paragraphs from being
created).  The best place to put this would be at the very top or
bottom of the page.

@node Non-existent Links, Special Markups, Lisp Tricks, Markup Rules
@section Non-existent Links

By default, non-existent links are converted into mailto: links in
published HTML. This allows website visitors to e-mail
@code{emacs-wiki-maintainer} for missing information. If you want
non-existent links to be rendered as plain text, set
@code{emacs-wiki-markup-nonexistent-link} to nil.

In HTML served directly from Emacs using httpd and
emacs-wiki-httpd.el, non-existent links are always editable links.

@node Special Markups,  , Non-existent Links, Markup Rules
@section Special Markups

For specially marking up Wiki text, XML-style tags are the best way to
add custom markup to Emacs Wiki, which expects a closing tag and/or an
optional set of attributes. This is easily accomplished by customizing
this list of markup tags defined in @code{emacs-wiki-markup-tags}.

Here is a summary of the default tags. This also includes the dangerous
tags listed in @code{emacs-wiki-dangerous-tags}, which may not be used
by outsiders.

Please refer to document of @code{emacs-wiki-markup-tags} and
@code{emacs-wiki-dangerous-tags} for detail infomation and customization
instructions.

@emph{verbatim}

Protects against highlighting and wiki interpretation, and escapes any
characters which have special meaning to the publishing format. For
HTML, this means characters like '<' are escaped as HTML entities.

@emph{example}

Like verbatim, but typesets in HTML using the <pre> tag, with
class=example, so whitespace formatting is preserved.

@emph{nowiki}

Inhibits wiki markup, but does not do any escaping to the underlying
publishing medium. Useful for embedding HTML, PHP, etc.

@emph{verse}

Typesets like a normal paragraph, but without word-wrapping. That is,
whitespace is preserved.

@emph{redirect}

Using the "url" attribute, you can specify that a page should redirect
to another page. The remaining contents of the page will not be
published. The optional "delay" attribute specifies how long to wait
before redirecting.

@emph{nop}

When placed before a WikiLink, it will prevent that WikiLink from being
treated as such. Good for names like DocBook.

@emph{contents}

Produces a compact table of contents for any section heading at the same
level or lower than the next section header encountered. Optional
"depth" attribute specifies how deep the table of contents should go.

@emph{lisp}

Evaluate the region as a Lisp form, and displays the result. When
highlighting, the `display' text property is used, preserving the
underlying text. Turn off font-lock mode if you wish to edit it.

@emph{command}

Pass the region to a command interpretor and insert the result, guarding
it from any further expansion. Optional "file" attribute specifies the
shell or interpretor to use. If none is given, and
@code{emacs-wiki-command-tag-file} has not been configured, Eshell is
used.

@emph{python, perl}

Pass the region to the Python or Perl language interpretor, and insert
the result.

@emph{c-source}

Markup the region as C or C++ source code, using the c2html program, if
available. Optional boolean attribute "numbered" will cause source lines
to be numbered.

Note: If c2html is not available, the region will be converted to HTML
friendly text (i.e., <> turns into &lt;&gt;), and placed in a <pre>
block. In this case, line numbering is not available.

@emph{bookmarks}

Insert bookmarks at the location of the tag from the given bookmarks
file. Required attribute "file" specifies which file to read from, and
the optional attribute "type" may be one of: adr (for Opera), lynx,
msie, ns, xbel or xmlproc. The default type is "xbel". The optional
attribute "folder" may be used to specify which folder (and its
children) should be inserted.

@chapter Multiple Projects
@cindex @file{emacs-wiki-project.el}, using
@cindex multiple projects
@cindex interwiki links

Emacs-wiki has a way of supporting multiple Wiki projects.  This
allows you to make links from one project to another, which are often
called @dfn{interwiki links}.  This can be convenient if you wish to
split your website according to the kind of content, for example.

For now, it is considered good practice to have your multiple projects
under a common directory, and not to nest your projects.

You will need something like the following in your @file{.emacs} file
in order to set up multiple project support.

@lisp
(setq emacs-wiki-projects
      `(("WebWiki" .
         ((emacs-wiki-directories . ("~/proj/wiki/webpage"))
          (emacs-wiki-project-server-prefix . "../wiki/")
          (emacs-wiki-publishing-directory
           . "~/personal-site/site/wiki")))
        ("ProjectsWiki" .
         ((emacs-wiki-directories . ("~/proj/wiki/projects"))
          (emacs-wiki-project-server-prefix . "../projects/")
          (emacs-wiki-publishing-directory
           . "~/personal-site/site/projects")))))
@end lisp

The first phrase on the second line of code is the name of the
project.  In this example, there are two projects, WebWiki and
ProjectsWiki.  It would be best for these names to be in @ref{Wiki
Concepts, mixed case}.

The @dfn{emacs-wiki-directories} line indicates which source
directories correspond with the particular project.  This must be a
list.

@dfn{emacs-wiki-project-server-prefix} is the text that will be put at
the beginning of each interwiki link at publish time.  For example,
@samp{WebWiki#MyPage} would be rendered @samp{../wiki/MyPage.html} in
its published (HTML) form.  It is also acceptable to give an absolute
location here, like @samp{/projects}, with the root directory
corresponding to your root web publishing directory.

@dfn{emacs-wiki-publishing-directory} is the directory where the HTML
content will be placed upon publishing the project.  You should make
sure that the content of @code{emacs-wiki-project-server-prefix} is
such that a link from a file in one project to a file in another
project is feasible.

Other variables can also be defined in this block if you wish to
customize a particular project further.

@appendixsec Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

@iftex
@appendixsec TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
@end ifinfo

@enumerate 0
@item
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

@item
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

@item
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

@enumerate a
@item
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

@item
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

@item
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
@end enumerate

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

@item
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

@enumerate a
@item
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
@end enumerate

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

@item
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

@item
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

@item
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

@item
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

@item
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

@item
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any
later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

@item
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

@appendixsec Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

@smallexample
@var{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}
Copyright (C) @var{yyyy}  @var{name of author}

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.
@end smallexample

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

@smallexample
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19@var{yy} @var{name of author}
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
@end smallexample

The hypothetical commands @samp{show w} and @samp{show c} should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than @samp{show w} and
@samp{show c}; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items---whatever
suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ``copyright disclaimer'' for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

@example
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

@var{signature of Ty Coon}, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice
@end example

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document @dfn{free} in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

@item
APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The ``Document'', below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as ``you''.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
@sc{ascii} without markup, Texinfo input format, La@TeX{} input
format, @acronym{SGML} or @acronym{XML} using a publicly available
@acronym{DTD}, and standard-conforming simple @acronym{HTML},
PostScript or @acronym{PDF} designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include @acronym{PNG}, @acronym{XCF} and
@acronym{JPG}.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, @acronym{SGML} or
@acronym{XML} for which the @acronym{DTD} and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated @acronym{HTML},
PostScript or @acronym{PDF} produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

The ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section ``Entitled XYZ'' means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', ``Endorsements'', or ``History''.)  To ``Preserve the Title''
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

@item
VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

@item
COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

@item
MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

@enumerate A
@item
Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

@item
List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

@item
State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

@item
Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

@item
Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

@item
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

@item
Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

@item
Include an unaltered copy of this License.

@item
Preserve the section Entitled ``History'', Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

@item
Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

@item
For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'', Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

@item
Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

@item
Delete any section Entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

@item
Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ``Endorsements'' or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

@item
Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
@end enumerate

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties---for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

@item
COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History''
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
and any sections Entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all
sections Entitled ``Endorsements.''

@item
COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

@item
AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

@item
TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

@item
TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

@item
FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/}.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

@page
@appendix ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

@smallexample
@group
  Copyright (C)  @var{year}  @var{your name}.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
@end group
@end smallexample

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the ``with...Texts.'' line with this:

@smallexample
@group
    with the Invariant Sections being @var{list their titles}, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being @var{list}, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being @var{list}.
@end group
@end smallexample

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
